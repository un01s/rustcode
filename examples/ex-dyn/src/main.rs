//!
//! once a trait has been declared, it can be used either as a trait or
//! as a type. 
//! 
//! since Rust 1.27, dyn is introduced.
//!
//! Trait objects are the Rust implementation of dynamic dispatch. 
//! Dynamic dispatch allows one particular implementation of a polymorphic 
//! operation (trait methods) to be chosen at run time. Dynamic dispatch allows
//! a very flexible architecture because we can swap function implementations 
//! out at runtime. However, there is a small runtime cost associated with 
//! dynamic dispatch.
//!
//! The variables/parameters which hold the trait objects are fat pointers 
//! which consists of the following components:
//! 
//! pointer to the object in memory
//! pointer to that objectâ€™s vtable, a vtable is a table with pointers which 
//!     point to the actual method(s) implementation(s).

// static dispatch (compile time): compiler must know specific versions
