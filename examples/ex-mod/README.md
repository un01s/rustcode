deal with rust modules: how to arrange code and manage its visibility, either public or private.

a module is a collection of items: functions, structs, traits, impl blocks, and other modules.

By default, the items in a module is private. To make them visible from the outside, use the pub modifier. Only the public items of a module can be accessed from outside the module scope.
