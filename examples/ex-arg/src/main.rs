 * fat pointer
 *
 * Fat pointer generally refers to a pointer that stores some extra data 
 * besides just the address of the object being pointed to.
 * 
 * The term "fat pointer" is used to refer to references and raw pointers to 
 * dynamically sized types (DSTs) â€“ slices or trait objects. A fat pointer 
 * contains a pointer plus some information that makes the DST "complete" 
 * (e.g. the length).
 *
 * Most commonly used types in Rust are not DSTs but have a fixed size known 
 * at compile time. These types implement the Sized trait. Even types that 
 * manage a heap buffer of dynamic size (like Vec<T>) are Sized, as the 
 * compiler knows the exact number of bytes a Vec<T> instance will take up on 
 * the stack. There are currently four different kinds of DSTs in Rust. 
 *
 * - slices ([T] and str)
 * - trait objects (dyn Trait)
 * - custom DSTs
 * - exception: Extern types 
 *
 * str vs String
 *
 * String is a dynamic heap string type, like vec. use it when you need to own 
 * or modify your string data.
 * str is an immutable sequence of UTF-8 bytes of dynamic length 
 * &str a reference to some UTF-8 data, normally called a string slice.
 * a slice is just a view onto some data, and that data can be anaywhere
 * - in static storage: a string literal "foo" is &'static str. the data is
 *   hardcoded into the executable and loaded into memory when the program 
 *   runs.
 * - inside a heap allocated String
 * - on the stack
 *
 * use String if you have to own string data like passing strings to other
 * threads or building them at runtime., and use &str if you only need a view
 * of a string.
